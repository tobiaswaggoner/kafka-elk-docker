# kafka-elk-docker
## Overview
This repo is part of an effort to redesign an existing ELK stack 
and make it more reliable and able to handle bigger volumes of data 
for a large retail company by introducing kafka as a buffer to
prevent back pressure from expansive logstash transformation to
block log processing.
